                Ideation followed suit, acting as the refining process for the ideas generated during brainstorming. Through careful evaluation, the team narrowed down the options to identify the most viable solutions. For instance, taking inspiration from other existing-application, e.g., LumiHealth, Lifesum, and fitbit as our starting point. Hence, this iterative nature of ideation enabled continuous improvement, getting the team nearer to a clearly defined product development path.
